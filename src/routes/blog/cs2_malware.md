## What we know

**Key Points**
- The malware is an Exodus Wallet Stealer.
- If you don't have Exodus Wallet you are not effected.
- The claims from others that this "Digs into your BIOS", "Injects your macros", "Sideloads stuff", "Hijacks this", "Detonates that", or similar claims are **false**.
- Windows Defender has added a signature for this malware (`Trojan:Win32/Shelood`)

**Attack Chain**
1. The DllMain function in FastMath.dll is run.
2. FastMath.dll extracts, decrypts and executes a second stage.
3. Stage 2 steals your Exodus Wallet seed phrase and exfiltrates it to the following IP via 3 domains, one of which is defunct.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** - also available in [STIX](#) format (WIP, SOON)
- `hxxps://pricing[.]a[.]exodus[.]io/ticker` - not generally malicious, but the stage 2 payload interacts with this API
- `45[.]9[.]149[.]215` - c2 ip
- `ms-defender-analytics[.]line[.]pm` - c2 domain
- `ms-analytics[.]mywire[.]org` - c2 domain
- `ms-cdn[.]viewdns[.]net` - c2 domain
- `8c6c3f9b3fd8497322cd9e798790aa3485a44f9c5418bb4aa97b630a3fb8cead` - sha256 of FastMath.dll
- `671c26b7d17db3af70f7ad24e48cf9eabdbac68a9604fa1b803608cff8a5df79` - sha256 of stage 2 (for reference, will not appear in memory or on-disk)

- https://tria.ge/241102-21qhqs1lgj - note: other behavioural analysis runs of this have been **incorrectly** marked as malicious as the person tried to download directX, or [other malware](https://tria.ge/241102-qetsgsvgnr/behavioral1) from chrome inside the sandbox.
## What you need to do if you think you were infected

1. Uninstall CS2, as well as the modpack.

## FAQ

> I play CS2. I use this mod. Am I effected?

For this, I would follow the official advice from the [CS2 forum post](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/important-update-regarding-the-traffic-mod.1712835/post-29976957):
```
 - If you have played using the affected version, please check your local files. If you have any malicious files installed, you will find them here; %localappdata%low\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\.cache\Mods\mods_subscribed\ inside the folder 80095_13.  
- Note that it is only **specifically the 80095_13 folder** that will contain malicious files; if you do not see this folder, you do not have the compromised version of the mod.
```

> Are my external drives effected?

No, not that we know of.

> Was it targeting any other cryptocurrency wallets?

No, not that we know of. The only activity we saw targeted Exodus (specifically, it tries to read `%s\AppData\Roaming\Exodus\exodus.wallet\seed.seco`).
